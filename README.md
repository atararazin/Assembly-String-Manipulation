# Assembly-String-Manipulation

## What This Program Does
This project is my assembly project in the course Computer Structures. The program does some string manipulations.

## How To Run It
First, this program will only run in Linux! 
Now that your on your Linux:
1. Optional: if you would like to compile it, there is a makefile for that. Simply type into the terminal "make" and it will 
produce the object files and an executable file called a.out. To run it go to step 2.

2. Type into the terminal "./a.out". And the program is running!
