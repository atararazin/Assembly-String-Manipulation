# Assembly-String-Manipulation

## What This Program Does
This project is my assembly project in the course Computer Structures. The program does some string manipulations. More details
to follow.
We create a structure that we called a "pstring". A pstring is a struct composed of an int and a string. The int is the size, followed by a string of that size. For example: "5hello", the 5 representing the size of the string "hello".

## How To Run It
First, this program will only run in Linux! 
Now that your on your Linux:
1. Optional: if you would like to compile it, there is a makefile for that. Simply type into the terminal "make" and it will 
produce the object files and an executable file called a.out. To run it go to step 2.

2. Type into the terminal `./a.out`

## How To Use This Program
First, we get the two pstrings. Then we have 5 options of string manipulations:
### Option 50
Prints the two pstrings and their legnths.

### Option 51
Replaces a specific char in each pstring with a given char from user.
After inputting both pstrings, type another line of the following format :"%c %c\n" (char space char newline).
The first char is the one to be replaced, the second the one to replace with.

### Option 52

### Option 53

### Option 54
